\arguments{
\item{data}{A list of dataframes, typically generated by a call to load_data. Must include demographics, and the diagnosis AND/OR patient problem tables. Only EMR data needs to be uploaded.}

\item{inclusion}{diagnosis category of ICD 10 codes to search for. Can choose between predefined categories (included codes are detailed in Diagnosis_EMR_Extract.Rd) or enter a custom defined list.}

\item{exclusion}{diagnosis category of ICD 10 codes to exclude from search. Will be input as custom list, may add predefined lists in future updates.}

\item{custominc}{optional list of custom ICD 10 codes to be searched for. The variable "inclusion" must also be set to "CUSTOM" for this option. If multiple inputs, needs to be in a regular expression string (eg. "argument1|argument2|argument3")}

\item{customexc}{optional list of custom ICD 10 codes to be excluded from the search. The variable "exclusion" must also be set to "CUSTOM" for this option. If multiple inputs, needs to be in a regular expression string (eg. "argument1|argument2|argument3")}

\item{datecutoff}{Type of date cutoff to be used for EMR extract. Current options include "ENROLLMENT" - number of days before consent into study.}

\item{index_range}{Number of days before date cutoff to be used for EMR extract. Time must be specified in number of days. Default is 36500 days (100 years).}

# example with custom category (all cancer diagnoses excluding cervical carcinomas)
#example with predefined category

#cancerdx_woutskin = diagnosis_emr_extract(data, inclusion="CANCER", exclusion = "SKIN CARCINOMA")
